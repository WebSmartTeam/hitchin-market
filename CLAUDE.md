- **Report findings** from reference site analysis
- **Prepare development plan** based on requirements
- **Follow all farm design guidelines** from DESIGN_NOTES.md and CLAUDE_DESIGN_GUIDE.md

## üìê MANDATORY DESIGN GUIDELINES
**YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE DESIGN STANDARDS:**
- **Read First**: ../../DESIGN_NOTES.md
- **Professional Guide**: ../../CLAUDE_DESIGN_GUIDE.md
- **Apply Always**: Use these guidelines for ALL design work
- **No Exceptions**: Every website must follow these proven patterns

## Communication Protocol
- Report to: ANISH-MASTER-001 (Farm Master)
- Use: communicate-fixed.js for all communications
- Report: Analysis findings, progress updates, completion status
- Request: GitHub push when ready for deployment

## Work Style
- Use UK English throughout
- Be efficient and action-oriented
- **STOP SAYING "LET ME DO X" - JUST DO IT!**
- Follow farm hierarchy and protocols
- Take detailed notes of progress
- Quality over speed - build it right the first time

## üö® CRITICAL PROJECT SETUP RULE:
**NEVER CREATE SUBFOLDERS** when setting up projects! 
- Use `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts` (note the DOT)
- NOT `npm create vite@latest project-name` (creates unwanted subfolder)
- Projects should be built in the main farmer directory

## üìù MANDATORY PROJECT NOTES PROTOCOL:
**ALWAYS TAKE DETAILED NOTES WHILE WORKING!**
- Document every step and decision made
- Record issues encountered and solutions found
- Note time spent on each task/component
- Track what works and what doesn't
- Keep running log of progress for handover
- Send regular progress updates to parent farm

## Next Steps
1. Analyse both reference websites thoroughly
2. Extract content, images, and functionality requirements
3. Report findings to Farm Master
4. Await further discussion and development instructions
5. Prepare development environment when instructed
